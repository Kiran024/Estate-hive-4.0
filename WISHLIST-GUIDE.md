# 🏠 Estate Hive - Wishlist/Saved Properties System

## ✨ **Complete Wishlist Implementation**

The wishlist system is now fully integrated across the application with proper user-specific access control and security.

---

## 🎯 **How It Works**

### **1. User-Specific Wishlist**
- Each user has their own private wishlist
- Properties saved by one user are NOT visible to other users
- Wishlist data is stored in the `saved_properties` table with user_id reference
- Row Level Security (RLS) ensures data privacy

### **2. Where Users Can Save Properties**

#### **📍 Home Page - Property Listings**
- Heart button on each property card in the carousel
- Click to save/unsave properties
- Visual feedback with filled/unfilled heart icon

#### **📍 All Properties Page** (`/properties`)
- Floating heart button on property cards
- Appears on hover for desktop
- Always visible on mobile
- Quick save without leaving the page

#### **📍 Property Details Page** (`/properties/:id`)
- Large wishlist button next to share button
- Clear visual indicator if property is saved
- One-click save/unsave functionality

---

## 🔐 **Security & Privacy**

### **Database Level Security**
```sql
-- RLS Policies ensure users can only:
- View their own saved properties
- Add to their own wishlist  
- Remove from their own wishlist
- Cannot access other users' wishlists
```

### **Application Level Security**
- Authentication required to save properties
- Non-logged users redirected to `/auth` page
- Session validation on every wishlist operation
- Proper error handling for unauthorized access

---

## 📱 **User Experience Features**

### **Visual Feedback**
- ❤️ **Empty Heart**: Property not saved
- ❤️ **Filled Red Heart**: Property is saved
- 🔄 **Loading Spinner**: During save/unsave operation
- ✅ **Toast Notifications**: Success/error messages

### **Smart Interactions**
- **Not Logged In?** → Redirected to login with return path
- **Already Saved?** → Shows filled heart immediately
- **Network Error?** → Graceful error handling with retry
- **Quick Actions** → No page reload needed

---

## 👤 **User Journey**

### **First Time User**
1. Browse properties without login
2. Click heart to save → Redirected to `/auth`
3. Login or signup
4. Automatically returned to property
5. Property is saved to wishlist

### **Returning User**
1. Login to account
2. Previously saved properties show filled hearts
3. Access saved properties from:
   - Profile dropdown → "Saved Properties"
   - Direct URL: `/saved`
4. Manage wishlist from saved properties page

---

## 📊 **Saved Properties Page Features** (`/saved`)

### **View Options**
- **Grid View**: Card layout with images
- **List View**: Compact layout for scanning

## 🎨 **WishlistButton Component**

### **Usage**
```jsx
<WishlistButton 
  propertyId={propertyId}  // Required: Property ID
  variant="default"         // Options: default, floating, compact
  size="md"                // Options: sm, md, lg
  showText={false}         // Show "Save/Saved" text
/>
```

### **Variants**
- **Default**: Standard button with border

- **Small (sm)**: 32x32px - For property cards
- **Medium (md)**: 40x40px - Standard size
- **Large (lg)**: 48x48px - For detail pages

---

## 🗄️ **Database Structure**

### **saved_properties Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE saved_properties (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  property_id INTEGER REFERENCES properties(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(user_id, property_id)  -- Prevents duplicate saves
);
```

### **Key Features**
- Unique constraint prevents duplicate saves
- Cascade delete removes saves when user deleted
- Indexed for fast queries
- Timestamp tracks when saved

---

## 📈 **User Statistics**

The profile page shows wishlist statistics:
- **Properties Saved**: Total count of saved properties
- **Properties Viewed**: Tracking user activity
- **Member Since**: User registration date
- **Recent Activity**: Last saved properties

---

## 🚀 **Testing the Wishlist System**

### **Test Scenarios**

1. **Save Property (Not Logged In)**
   - Click heart on any property
   - Should redirect to `/auth`
   - After login, return to property

2. **Save Property (Logged In)**
   - Click heart on property
   - Heart fills with red color
   - Toast shows "Added to wishlist!"
   - Property appears in `/saved`

3. **Unsave Property**
   - Click filled heart
   - Heart becomes empty
   - Toast shows "Removed from wishlist!"
   - Property removed from `/saved`

4. **View Saved Properties**
   - Navigate to `/saved`
   - See all saved properties
   - Search/filter/sort functionality
   - Remove properties from list

5. **User Privacy**
   - Login as User A, save properties
   - Logout and login as User B
   - User B should NOT see User A's saved properties
   - Each user has isolated wishlist

```

### **Database Setup**
Run `database-setup.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor to create:
